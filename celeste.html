                <p>Dear Claud- erm Celeste,</p>

                <p>Thank you for being such an amazing friend and for the hospitality you showed me by welcoming me into your home! It meant so much to have a place to stay and feel so comfortable.</p>

                <p>From Knott's Berry Farm to your house, you made everything so much more fun and memorable. You have a special way of making everyone feel included and bringing joy to every moment!</p>

                <p>Even though you might be short in height, you're definitely tall in friendship, kindness, and fun! I'll treasure it forever.</p>

                <p>I'm so glad I got to share my time in LA with you. Looking forward to many more!</p>

                <p> class="signature">With gratitude and friendship,<br>YUNJIN is mine <3 </p>
