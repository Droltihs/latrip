                <p>HI Shell (Shelly Feng of Canada),</p>

                <p>Thank you for being such a skibidi! Your vibe was straight up six seven the entire trip and you made everything so much more fun.</p>

                <p>You're lowkey awkward but like the skibidi funny kind of awkward that's literally six seven! Your no cap sense of humor and main character energy kept us all laughing through every adventure, even when things got a little delulu!</p>

                <p>The trip was lowkey so much better because you were there. Your vibes were immaculate and you brought that six seven energy everywhere we went!</p>

                <p>I'm so thankful to have had you on this journey with us. Can't wait for the next one!</p>

                <p class="signature">With gratitude and friendship,<br>WE NEED THE TALKING CAPYBARA VIDEO</p>
